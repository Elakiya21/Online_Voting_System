# Online_Voting_System

MY project is to design an ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM  which meets the electoral needs Of a specific university . It is a college specific online voting system. It initiates with a login page were the user can login with his mail id or if the user is new to the page... The user is recommended to register with name, mail, dept and phone number in the registration page. Once the user has registered the online voting system leaves an OTP sent to the registered mail. Now the user is prompted to login using the OTP and the corresponding mail id and those two are cross verified and if any mismatch in the OTP AND MAIL or if the user attempts to Relogin with same credentials ,the user is not allowed to login to the online voting process, so that one person can cast only one vote thereby making our voting system pretty valid. If the user logs in with the verified otp and mail it takes us to the actual voting page were the user can cast vote for the desired Party and the vote is recorded in the database. After the entire voting process finishes the candidates with highest vote is calculated by using queries and the winning result is sent to all the registered mails.
